## ‚ú® Features

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Capture **TCP**, **UDP**, and **ICMP** packets in real-time
- üîç Intelligent filtering by **port** and **protocol**
- üö´ Option to skip encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS on port 443)
- üìä Real-time summary of **top IPs** and **most active ports** every 30 seconds
- üé® Colorful CLI output with a professional banner
- üß© Minimal dependencies for easy setup and portability

---

## üéØ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (version 1.18+ recommended)
2. **libpcap** development files:
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`
   - CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install libpcap-devel`
   - macOS: `brew install libpcap`
   - Windows: Install [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) with development files

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ZeroHack01/sniphawk.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd sniphawk

# Install required Go packages
go get github.com/google/gopacket
go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap
go get github.com/fatih/color

# Build the binary
go build -o sniphawk sniphawk.go

# Or alternatively with go mod:
go mod init github.com/ZeroHack01/sniphawk
go mod tidy
go build
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter errors like `pcap.h: No such file or directory`:
- Make sure libpcap development files are installed
- On Windows, ensure Npcap is installed with the SDK option

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Step 1: Find your network interface

First, find your active network interface name:

```bash
# On Linux
ip a

# On macOS
ifconfig

# On Windows
ipconfig
```

Look for interfaces like `eth0`, `wlan0`, `en0`, or similar that show your active connection.

### Step 2: Run Sniphawk

Run with `sudo` (required for packet capture):

```bash
# Basic usage with default interface (eth0)
sudo ./sniphawk

# Specify a different interface (example: wlan0)
sudo ./sniphawk -i wlan0

# Or using the long flag format
sudo ./sniphawk --interface=wlan0
```

### Step 3: View network traffic

Once running, Sniphawk will:
1. Display the colorful banner
2. Start capturing and displaying packets in real-time
3. Show traffic summaries every 30 seconds

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the capture.

### Complete Flag Reference

| Flag | Short | Description | Example | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `--interface` | `-i` | Network interface to capture on | `--interface=wlan0` | `eth0` |
| `--port` | `-p` | Filter by specific port | `--port=80` | `0` (all ports) |
| `--protocol` | `-proto` | Filter by protocol | `--protocol=tcp` | all protocols |
| `--skip-encrypted` | `-s` | Skip HTTPS traffic | `--skip-encrypted=false` | `true` |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | `--help` | n/a |

### Examples

```bash
# Capture only HTTP traffic (port 80)
sudo ./sniphawk -i eth0 -p 80

# Capture only TCP traffic including encrypted traffic
sudo ./sniphawk -i wlan0 --protocol=tcp --skip-encrypted=false

# Capture only UDP traffic (e.g., DNS)
sudo ./sniphawk -i eth0 --protocol=udp
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Example Output & Interpretation

When running, Sniphawk captures packets and displays them in a colorful, easy-to-read format:

```
üïí Timestamp: 2025-05-15T19:47:18+06:00
üîó IP: 192.168.0.109 ‚Üí 104.18.32.47 | Protocol: TCP
üì¶ TCP: 47812 ‚Üí 443
üìù Payload: [Binary or Encrypted Data]
----------------------------------------------------
```

### Understanding the Output

Each packet is broken down into:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| üïí | When the packet was captured | `2025-05-15T19:47:18+06:00` |
| üîó | Source and destination IP addresses + Protocol | `192.168.0.109 ‚Üí 104.18.32.47 | Protocol: TCP` |
| üì¶ | TCP port information (if TCP packet) | `47812 ‚Üí 443` (local port ‚Üí destination port) |
| üì® | UDP port information (if UDP packet) | `53212 ‚Üí 53` (typically DNS traffic) |
| üí• | ICMP information (if ICMP packet) | `ICMP Packet Detected` |
| üìù | Payload/data content (may be encrypted) | `[Binary or Encrypted Data]` |

### Traffic Summary Analysis

Every 30 seconds, Sniphawk displays a traffic summary:

```
üìä ==== Sniphawk Traffic Summary (last 30s) ==== üìä
Top IPs:
  192.168.0.109 : 120 packets (Your device)
  104.18.32.47  : 80 packets  (Remote server)
  142.250.196.35: 50 packets  (Google server)

Top Ports:
  443: 130 packets (HTTPS)
  80 : 60 packets  (HTTP)
  53 : 40 packets  (DNS)
==============================================
```

This summary helps you quickly identify:
- Which devices are communicating most frequently
- Which services (ports) are most active
- Potential security concerns (unexpected connections)

### Common Network Patterns

| Port | Service | What it typically means |
|------|---------|-------------------------|
| 80   | HTTP    | Web browsing (unencrypted) |
| 443  | HTTPS   | Secure web browsing |
| 53   | DNS     | Domain name lookups |
| 67/68| DHCP    | Obtaining IP addresses |
| 22   | SSH     | Secure terminal connections |
| 25   | SMTP    | Email sending |
